# Machine and Deep Learning Project - Image and Text Classification+Anomaly detection

Design and implementation of AdaBoost, SVM, kNN, Bayes classifiers and neural networks (DNNs, CNNs) to classify images and text sentences in multiple classes. 
Moreover, there are different AutoEncoder (denses and convolutionals) implementations to perform a semi-supervised anomaly detection.
